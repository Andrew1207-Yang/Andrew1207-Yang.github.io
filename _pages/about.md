About Me
======

Hi, I'm Yao-An Yang, a senior majoring in Computer Science and Physics at the University of Michigan.

I am currently advised by Prof. [Joyce Chai](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~chaijy/) where I work with [Ziqiao Ma](https://mars-tin.github.io/) on **Vision Language Model grounding and fine-grained understanding**, as well as **Large Language Model memory and reaction to patterns**. Previously, I was advised by Prof. [Danai Koutra](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~dkoutra/) where I worked on **link prediction with graph neural network** with Dr. [Jiong Zhu](https://www.jiongzhu.net/) and **LLM-GNN models for text attributed graphs** with [Donald Loveland](https://www.donaldloveland.com/).

Before that, I've worked on building cyrogenic particle detectors with Prof. [Wolfgang Lorenzon](https://public.websites.umich.edu/~lorenzon/).
